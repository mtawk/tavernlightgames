Hi Victor,

When I received the assessment I was traveling with my family and didn't have enough time, less than 2 days, to complete it. I completely understand that this is no excuse for the hiring manager. Today is my deadline, and since the job at Tavernligh really interests me, I didn't give up, and here's what I did at the last minute:
- Build the server "theforgottenserver" with vcpkg using release 1.4
- Build the OtClient with vcpkg using the release master.
- Set up the uniform service zero version 15.0.2, which is compatible with the server version 1.4.
-Configure the web site with Znote AAC branch v2.
-Connect the client to the server and create my characters.
-Perform dynamic reverse engineering to familiarize myself with the flow of your solution (from the lua scripts through the otc client to the server).
-etc.

I've finished questions Q1-Q4, and since I'm running out of time to address q5, q6, and q7. I made an attempt that I show in the video in my repo. The player moves on axis y and once clicked, it changes randomly on axis x (close to the bare of question Q5) and close to the case of Q6 but I miss the replication of the shadow because no time.

I was not blocked in all this but I overunned. 

Attached:

- Answers of Q1-Q4
- Video of my try
- The implementation and header files where I modified to autowalk method to implement a try example.
