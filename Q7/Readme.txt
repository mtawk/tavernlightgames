Hi Victor,

Thank you for your confidence in giving me a chance.
After your last email, I took the afternoon off today to address question 7. In my git repo there is the Q7 folder which contains the video and the modified lua files. Normally I would have had to create a separate file, but I wanted to do something quick and clean at the same time. I created two unencapsulated windows with two layers to dynamically calculate the position limits. I think I have a good understanding of the following concepts: events, callback, as well as the languages lua and C++. All of this is related to geometric calculations for position manipulation and movement. The fact that I have configured your client-server environment and scripts and understand your architecture shows my ability to adapt easily. I hope you'll give me the chance to be an added value to your team.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
